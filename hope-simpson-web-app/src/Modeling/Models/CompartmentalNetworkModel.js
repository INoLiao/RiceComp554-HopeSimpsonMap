			<h3>Compartmental Network Models</h3>
			<h4>The Basics</h4>
			<p>
				Compartmental models are commonly used for infectious diseases.
				The fundamentals of compartmental modeling of infectious diseases are nearly a hundred years old â€“ Kermack and McKendrick proposes a simple compartmental model with differential equations that assign individuals to be susceptible, infected or recovered (SIR) compartments.
				Several infectious diseases, including COVID-19, manifest an incubation period during which an individual is infected but is not yet a spreader.
				To this end, an Exposed (E) compartment can be added, which results in an SEIR model.

			<h4>Time-varying modeling of variables:</h4>
			<p>
				Ideally, instead of using static rate variables across time to model compartment transitions as in standard compartmental models, there should be time-varying functions that map them from known observations.
				For example, if human mobility decreases over time, the S to E transition should reflect that.
			</p>
			<p>
				Another known effect of respiratory infections is the sesonal pattern. For instance, the Influenza virus is known for its peak around the winter months. Following the same idea we can model the Covid-19 evolution with an infection rate that is a function of the sun declination. Check our interactive model on the next tab to see the results and play with the parameters.
			</p>

			<h4>Features from the location network graph:</h4>
			<p>
				One way to incorporate inter-county effects is to represent the counties as nodes in a network graph with edges representing land borders.
				A simple model of the inter-county effects is one or more aggregation functions applied to the immediate neighborhood of each county, and the results incorporated as new features for that county.
