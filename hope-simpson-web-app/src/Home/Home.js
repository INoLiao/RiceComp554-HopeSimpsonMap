      <p className="lead">A very cordial welcome to the Hope-Simpson project started by a group of students from the fall 2020 class of COMP/ELEC 425/554! We created a platform based on modern databases, visualization, web design, virtual machines, signal processing, and data analysis. We applied this platform to analyzing COVID-19 data based on work from a study of the spread of the influenza virus by Robert Edgar Hope-Simpson. We hope you find our website compelling and insightful!</p>
      <p className="lead">On our home page, you can begin to explore COVID-19 cases around the world. The histogram displays confirmed cases in weekly increments based on the locations you selected.</p>

      <p className="lead">Let us take you through a journey of ways to look at the current worldwide pandemic through the lens of Hope-Simpson. Here is what you can find on our other pages:</p>
      <ul>
        <li className="lead"><strong>About:</strong> Slides about the background inspiration, which is the life work of Robert Edgar Hope-Simpson (1908-2003), a general practitioner who studied influenza cases around the world for sixty years. Also, an explanation of the Hope-Simpson concept and about our COVID-19 data.</li>
        <li className="lead"><strong>Tableau Map:</strong> Using Tableau, you can take a Hope-Simpson inspired look at COVID-19 through a sample of four latitude zones around the world. We compared and contrasted different regions and showed a north-to-south longitudinal slice of the Americas.</li>
        <li className="lead"><strong>GDS Map:</strong> Using Google Data Studio, you can dive into a detailed exploration of the data by date, country, latitude and longitude. We can see another view of the four-zones concept and the longitudinal slice of the Americas.</li>
        <li className="lead"><strong>Modeling:</strong> See early work of a compartmental network model of the virus spread and a Fourier-based analysis of the reported cases across the world.</li>
      </ul>
      <p className="lead">Finally, our site is designed to let you download the data so you can do your own investigation.</p>
